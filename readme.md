# Blender Adaptation of SkyRoads

## Overview
The original SkyRoads was created in 1993. Here, as an exercise and because it's a fun game, I've ported it over to Blender!

Currently there is only one level, and the menus don't really work. But you can see the game at least.

## Installation and Use

Copy all the files into a working directory. Open Blender and load the .blend file. Play the game by pressing P. Use Enter to begin the game.

Controls are the arrow keys and the left CTRL button. This is to accomodate keyboards which don't register multiple key inputs at once.

## Still to Do

1. Add Fuel and Oxygen Dials
2. Finish making the HUD
3. Add special surfaces like fire and slippery
4. More Levels and better navigation.

Have fun!
